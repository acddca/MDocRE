A dozen immigrants and refugees from different parts of the globe gather here in the kitchen of the Free Library of Philadelphia.
They’re participating in the library’s “Edible Alphabet” program.
So today is our last class and we are going to make a pizza.
In this program, we are using food as a vehicle for learning.
Each week, the students are learning English through a recipe, and they’re learning the names of ingredients.
They’re learning where to buy the ingredients.
They’re learning how to navigate a grocery store.
Each participant is partnered with another who’s native tongue is different from their own.
Today they discussed the pizza toppings.
And for B, the first picture is someone is, yes, mixing some ingredients, so you need to describe the picture to your partner.
The idea of “Edible Alphabet” was conceived three years ago
when nationality service center, a nonprofit organization that serves refugees,
brought a group of torture survivors to the library’s culinary literacy center for a tour.
Women from all over the world, many of whom didn’t speak English very well or at all.
And by the end of class, we were all sharing pictures of our families.
We were talking about our lives, communicating in any way that we could.
It was just a really beautiful moment, and so based on the success of that class, we decided to build “Edible Alphabet”.
So we are going to measure the, the dry ingredients, the flour, the salt, and the yeast, then we are gonna…
The six-week course is taught by two instructors, and English-as-a-second-language instructor and a chef instructor.
We choose our recipes for this class to give our students an idea of what American cuisine and cooking is all about.
For example, we choose a lesson on pancakes and use that as a springboard to talk about American breakfast traditions.
I think that this class gives our students the cultural literacy that they need to feel comfortable in their new home.
The students learn cooking techniques.
They make the meal and eat together at the end of the class.
I like this class very much because it was fun for me and it was more useful from other classes.
Our students are also sharing that they feel more comfortable in Philadelphia that’s been some feedback that we’ve gotten,
that after being in our class that Philadelphia seems to be a friendlier place,
and that to me is it’s just beautiful. it’s, it’s a real big part of why we’re doing this in the first place.

来自全球不同地区的十几个移民和难民聚集在费城自由图书馆的厨房里。
他们正在参加图书馆的一个名叫“可以吃的字母表”活动。
所以今天是我们的最后一堂课，我们要做一个披萨。
在这个活动里，我们把食物当做学习的工具。
每周，学生们都通过菜谱学英语，他们学配料的名称。
他们学到哪里去买配料。
他们还学怎么导航到杂货铺。
每个参与者都和与自己母语不同的人组成搭档。
今天他们讨论了披萨的装饰配料。
对B来说，第一张图是有个人在？对，搅拌一些调料，所以你们需要把这个图片描述给你的搭档。
“可以吃的字母表”这个活动创意始于三年前，
那时候非营利机构国家服务中心为难民提供服务，
他们带着饱受磨难后的幸存者来到图书馆的烹饪教育中心参观。
来了很多世界各地的女性，其中很多人英语说得不好，还有的根本就不会说英语。
课结束的时候，我们都分享家人照片给彼此。
我们谈论自己的生活，用任何可能的方式进行交流。
这真的是一个美好的时刻，因为这个活动很成功，我们决定开办“可以吃的字母表”活动。
所以我们要称干性的配料的重量，面粉，盐和酵母，然后我们再......
为期六周的课程由两位讲师授课，一名英语为第二语言的讲师和一名厨师讲师。
我们为课堂选择一个食谱，让学生了解美国美食和烹饪的基本内容。
例如，我们选择了一个关于煎饼的课，并将其作为跳板讨论美式早餐传统。
我觉得这门课能培养我们学生的文化素养，这种素养可以让他们在新环境中感到舒适。
学生们学习烹饪的技巧。
他们一起做饭，课堂结束时一起吃饭。
我非常喜欢这门课，因为对我来说十分有趣，比其他的课更有用。
我们的学生们也说他们在费城感觉更加自在些，这是我们得到的一些反馈，
后，费城都亲切不少。
得到这些反馈，感觉太棒了，这真的是我们做这件事的首要原因，也是重要原因。
