Outside of Facebook’s shareholders meeting, one man protests the social media giant.
The, the company is a terrible company and I think it’s a terrible stock to own right now.
His message to Facebook shareholders is simple.
Sell Facebook.
Investors, large and small, file in to tell company leaders what they think.
That’s particularly true this year in the wake of a user data scandal and reports on how Russian propaganda infiltrated Facebook to influence elections worldwide.
I want to see how Mark Zuckerberg and company are going to handle what happened last year with the infamous political scandal
where they use the Facebook data to influence our election.
In recent months, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has faced a barrage of questions about the service.
This has been an intense year!
The company’s stock plunged after reports that users data ended up with political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica,
but for some the crisis was an opportunity.
So I bought the Facebook shares after the Cambridge scandal broke and now it’s going up and I’ve had about thirteen percent gains on those holdings.
Natasha Lamb is the managing partner at Arjuna capital.
What we would like to see is that kind of transparency around reporting and so that that were not surprised like we’ve been this past year.
Those are disturbing revelations and it’s not an it’s not something that investors want popping up,
and you know experience the drop in market value from that.
Her proposals one on gender pay equity and another requiring Facebook to report on the content of its site both lost,
but she says it’s important to be at the meeting.
Its shareholder proposals send a signal to management, they send a signal to the board that they need to pay attention.
At the meeting, Zuckerberg acknowledges shift in the company’s approach.
We didn’t do enough to be proactive and looking at how people can try to abuse these tools.
The main thing that we need to do right now is make sure that we take a broader review of what our responsibility is to our community.
For shareholders, whether the company’s changes can translate into a boost in Facebook stock price remains to be seen.

在Facebook的股东大会之外，一名男子在抗议这家社交媒体巨头。
这家公司很糟糕，现在去买它的股票就太不理智了。
他想对Facebook股东说的话很简单。
卖了Facebook股票。
大大小小的投资者都发邮件告诉公司领导他们的想法。
今年情况更甚，尤其在用户数据丑闻和俄罗斯宣传渗透Facebook影响全球选举的报道爆出后更是如此。
我想看看扎克伯格和公司要如何处理去年这场臭名昭著的政治丑闻，
他们利Facebook数据影响我们的选举。
最近几个月，Facebook的首席执行官马克·扎克伯格面临着一连串有关该服务的问题。
今年真是紧张的一年！
自从报道Facebook用户数据被政治咨询公司剑桥分析盗用后，Facebook股票暴跌。
但是，对于某些人而言，这场危机却也是一个机遇。
我在剑桥丑闻爆出后买下了Facebook的股票，现在这支股票正在上涨，我持有的股份上涨了百分之十三。
Natasha Lamb是阿朱纳资本的任事股东。
我们希望看到的是报告透明化，这不足为奇，去年我们也这么要求。
这些是不妙的苗头，不是投资者想看到的，
你也知道，那样的话市值会下跌。
她建议男女报酬平等和要求Facebook公开其网站内容的提议均未得到采纳，
但她表示，在参加会议很重要。
股东的提议给管理层发出了一个信号，也就是董事会这样一个信号，这个信号他们不得不重视。
会议上，扎克伯格承认公司在做法上有所改变。
我们还不够积极主动，在看人们能怎么滥用这些工具上也做得不够。
我们现在主要要做的就是确保审查了自身对社区的责任。
对于股东而言，是否公司做出改变就能让Facebook股价提振还有待观察。
