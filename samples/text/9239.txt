The state of Texas has not fully recovered from last year’s hurricane, Harvey, as it prepares for a new season of storms.
Texas governor Greg Abbott spoke to reporters after a teleconference with President Trump and Federal Emergency Officials.
“We are ready, and we are taking steps on a daily basis to make sure we will be able to address any challenge coming our way.”
Hurricane Harvey brought record rainfall to a wide swath of Texas more rain fell over a five day period then at any time,
since records have been kept in the United States beginning in the 1850s.
Abbott said two new satellites and advanced tracking technology will help determine in advance the path and strength of the storms.
State and local governments are also planning evacuation routes, shelters, communication lines and supply chains to ensure efficient response to the storms.
“We are working to make sure that whether it be our work with the Red Cross, our work with other similar organizations,
is coordinated in advance to make sure that this will operate as seamless as possible.”
Last year’s deadly hurricanes including Harvey, Irma and Maria caused devastation in large parts of Texas,
Louisiana, the South Atlantic states, the Caribbean and Puerto Rico.
Trump praised what he called massive recovery and response efforts to the disasters.
“As we enter the hurricane season again, here we go, right? You are ready?”“yes, sir.”
“But we’re entering it. This is it. We are marshalling every available resource to ensure maximum preparation for rapid response.
That’s what we had last year. Disaster response and recovery is best achieved when it’s federally supported, state managed and locally executed.”
Scientists warn that, as the earth warms, storms are absorbing more moisture and are capable of producing more rainfall.
This year storms are also expected to be driven by exceptionally powerful winds.
Emergency Officials say the nation has to be prepared for ever more active storms in the future.
“We’ve got to keep building a culture preparedness in this state and in this nation.
The people in the Grange and other parts of the state have got to help themselves help us and we’ve got to start building that culture preparedness.”
Meteorologists predict up to 16 storms this summer including 5 to 9 hurricanes, the most active storms usually began in mid-august.

德克萨斯州还没有完全从去年的飓风“哈维”中恢复过来，又要为新的飓风季节做准备。
德克萨斯州州长格雷格·阿博特在与特朗普总统和联邦紧急事务官员举行电话会议后对记者发表了讲话。
我们已经做好了准备，我们每天都在采取措施，以确保能够应对即将到来的任何挑战。
飓风“哈维”给德克萨斯州的广大地区带来了有史以来最强降雨，
五天内的降雨量比19世纪50年代以来的任何时候都多。
阿博特说，两颗新型卫星和先进的追踪技术将有助于提前确定风暴的路径和强度。
州政府和地方政府也在规划疏散路线、避难所、通信线路和供应链，以确保有效应对即将来临的风暴。
我们正在努力确保，无论是我们与红十字会的工作，还是我们与其他类似组织的工作，
都提前得到协调，以确保这一工作将尽可能无缝地进行。
去年的致命飓风哈维、厄玛以及玛丽亚在德克萨斯州、
路易斯安那州、南大西洋州、加勒比和波多黎各的大部分地区造成了破坏。
特朗普赞扬了他所谓的大规模恢复和应对灾难的努力。
“我们再次进入飓风季了，现在已经开始了对吧？你们准备好了吗？”“准备好了。”
但我们正遭此大难。为了这，我们正在调集所有可用的资源，以做好灾后快速反应的最大准备。
这是我们去年的情况，在联邦支持、州政府管理、当地政府执行的状态下灾后应急和恢复工作得以最好的开展。
科学家警告说，随着地球变暖，风暴会吸收更多的水分，并能产生更多的降雨。
今年的风暴预计也将受到异常强劲的风力的影响。
紧急事务官员说，国家必须为未来更加活跃的风暴做好准备。
我们必须在该州以及整个国家内建立一种准备意识。
州内各地区人们需要互助、自助，我们需要建立这种准备文化。
气象学家预计，今年夏天将有多达16场风暴，其中包括5至9场飓风，最活跃的风暴通常始于8月中旬悄然而至。
