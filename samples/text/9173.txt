Soldiers walk across Arlington National Cemetery to place flags in front of more than 230,000 tombstones.
The flags honor the members of the Armed Forces who are buried here, many who gave their lives to defend their country.
Here lies a 21-year-old soldier killed during the war in Iraq in 2011.
His younger brother wanted to come here to deliver the flag himself.
“I love you. I’m sorry. And I miss you again. I hope I made you proud.”
The cemetery is adjacent to an army base, also the home of the Old Guard, the Army’s 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment.
This means these soldiers can visit the grave sites of friends, family and fellow soldiers they once served with.
“I do visit them more than just on today, like every couple of weeks I’ll come out and have a, have a chat during lunch.”
Boot by boot and with great care, the soldiers place a flag to honor a fallen comrade.
For this soldier it is a moving moment to be part of “Flags In” for the first time.
“To just see how many people lost their lives and to be able to put a flag on their tombstones, it means a lot to me.”
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence also came to show his respect.
And as the commander of the Old Guard quietly inserts flags on each grave, he tells us every soldier is significant.
“We’re all soldiers and it’s our ability to honor those that have gone before us
and to be able to do this for those families that can’t be here is really important.”
The flags stand in honor of these fallen soldiers, a tribute to their sacrifice.

在阿灵顿国家公墓，士兵们为公墓的23万多块墓碑前插上国旗。
以此向安眠在这里的士兵致以敬意，其中，很多士兵都是为国捐躯。
这里安葬着一名21岁的士兵，他在2011年的伊拉克战争中阵亡。
他的弟弟想亲自为他在墓碑前插上国旗。
“哥哥，我爱你。我很想你。我希望能成为你的骄傲。”
阿灵顿国家公墓毗邻陆军基地，也是号称“老卫队”的美国陆军第三步兵团的驻地。
因此这些士兵可以常去墓地看望逝去的朋友、亲人和战友。
“我不只是在国殇日才来这里看望他们。每隔几周我就会过来看看，用吃午饭的时间陪陪他们，聊聊天。”
士兵们神情肃穆，仪态庄重，向每一位阵亡将士敬献国旗。
对于这位士兵来说，是第一次参加敬献国旗仪式，她觉得很令人动容。
“看到有那么多人为国家献出了自己的生命，能够为他们在墓碑前插上一面国旗，对我来说，意义重大。”
美国副总统迈克·彭斯也参加了阵亡将士纪念活动。
“老卫队”的指挥官默默地在每座墓碑前插上国旗，他说，每个士兵都很重要。
“我们都是士兵，要缅怀那些走在我们前面的人，
有些士兵的家人不能亲到这里为他们献国旗，我们要代他们致敬，这很重要。”
一面面旗帜迎风飘扬，谨以此纪念每一位阵亡士兵，向他们致敬。
