Sheikh Mrat Alpeshimam with his wife and four children while life became too dangerous for the Yazidi people,
following the takeover of their homeland by the Islamic state extremists.
When asked about life in their home country, family members break into tears.
“We walked about 450 kilometers in the mountains, one of our kids was only four and the child had to walk with us.
There were no means of transportation, nothing.”
Sheikh Mrat’s family are Yazidis, a Kurdish religious minority that lives mostly in Iraq.
They had to leave a lot behind, including relatives some live in Iraqi refugee camps, others were murdered.
“My wife’s sister was killed, my cousins both males and females were kidnapped.
We were able to save two girls, but not the boys.
The girls managed to run away from their kidnappers.”
While their home town is considered safe after the militants were expelled.
The family is afraid to go back.
Too many of those who attempted to return to their village were blown up by mines led by the extremists.
After they fled, Mrat and his family spent 80 days hiding in the mountains with no food or water,
burning Sun during the day and freezing cold at night.
Thousands of children died in these conditions.
“When we were hiding in the mountains my four-year-old child was thirsty, but there was no water.
He was hungry but there was no food.
Every time that killed me as a mother.”
Finally they found safety in Armenia, where both the authorities and ordinary citizens welcomed them and offered them shelter and support.
And though living conditions are poor the family says life is so much better that what they had left behind in Iraq.

谢赫与妻子和四个孩子像所有雅兹迪人一样生活境况变得十分危险，
这种生活变化是在伊斯兰国极端组织接管他们那一地区之后。
被问及在本国的生活情况时，一家人纷纷落泪。
我们在山区走了近450千米，我们家的一个孩子只有四岁，孩子们也不得不跟我们一起走路。
没有任何交通工具，什么也没有。
谢赫一家是雅兹迪人，他们是居住在伊拉克库尔德地区的少数民族。
他们不得不抛弃一切背井离乡，很多亲戚住在伊拉克的难民营，其他人则被杀害了。
我妻子的妹妹被杀了，我的堂兄妹无论男女都被绑架了。
我们只救出了两个女孩，一个男孩都没救出来。
女孩们设法逃离了绑匪。
在武装分子被驱逐后，他们的家乡被认为是安全的，
但这家人害怕回去。
许多试图返回家乡的人被极端分子埋下的地雷炸得粉碎。
他们逃离家乡之后，谢赫一家在山里躲了80天，没有食物和水，
白天被太阳炙烤，晚上则寒冷刺骨，
成千上万的孩子在这种条件下夭折。
当我们躲在山里的时候，我四岁的孩子渴了没有水喝，
饿了没有食物，
每每这时候我这个做母亲的都像被杀了一样痛心。
最后，他们在亚美尼亚找到了安全的地方，当局和普通市民都欢迎他们，并向他们提供庇护和支持。
虽然生活条件很差，但这一家人表示，这里的生活比他们在伊拉克要好得多。
