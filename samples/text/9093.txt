US president Donald Trump revealed Tuesday that the nation’s top diplomat is in North Korea.
Plans are being made, relationships are building, hopefully a deal will happen.
Secretary Pompeo’s visit to Pyongyang is setting the stage for a possibly historic meeting between Kim Jeong-un and President Trump expected in early June.
We’ll see how it all works out.
Maybe it will, maybe it won’t.
But it can be a great thing for North Korea, South Korea, Japan and the entire world.
We hope it all works out.
It’s the secretary second trip to North Korea.
Pompeo secretly met with Kim in April while he was still head of the CIA
while the visit this time around is focused on achieving a framework for the unprecedented summit.
Pompeo says he hopes for more.
US officially have increasingly pushed for the release of three Americans detained by North Korea
on allegations of various acts considered hostile to the government.
It certainly would be a very welcome advance to see the North Koreans unilaterally provide these three American prisoners
that we’ve sought for a long time for their release.
I think the United States has been tried to be very clear that
this is not something that the United States will provide some sort of reciprocal concession for
but that it would be viewed very positively as a goodwill gesture ahead of the summit.
North Korea has in the past used visits by former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter to release other Americans it had in custody.
President Trump, when asked if the American prisoners will return with the secretary, made no promises.
We’ll all soon be finding out.
We will soon be finding out.

美国总统唐纳德·特朗普星期二透露，美国最高外交官正在朝鲜。
计划正在制定，关系正在建立，希望能达成协议。
蓬佩奥对平壤的访问正在为期待在6月初金正恩和特朗普之间可能举行的历史性会晤奠定基础。
我们会知道是否能成，
也许能成，也许不成，
但对朝鲜、韩国、日本和整个世界来说，这都是一件好事，
我们还是希望一切顺利。
这是国务卿第二次访问朝鲜。
今年4月，蓬佩奥与金正恩秘密会面，当时他仍是中情局局长，
而这次访问的重点是为这次史无前例的峰会建立一个框架。
蓬佩奥说他期待更多。
美方官员更主动地要求释放被北朝鲜扣押的3名美国人，
这些人被指控对朝鲜政府怀有敌意。
看到北朝鲜单方面提了我们长期以来寻求释放的这三名美国囚犯，
这当然是一种非常受欢迎的进展。
我认为，美国一直试图明确表示，
这并不是美国将提供的某种互惠的让步，
而是在峰会前将其视为一种友好姿态。
前总统比尔·克林顿和吉米·卡特朝鲜过去曾多次访问北朝鲜，以释放在押的其他美国人。
当被问及美国囚犯是否会和国务卿一起返回时，特朗普总统没有做出任何承诺。
我们很快就会发现，
很快就会发现。
